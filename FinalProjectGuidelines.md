## Final Project Guidelines

### Requirements

1. **2 points -- Write-up**

The write-up could be done as a text part of the .ipynb file or as a text document separate from the file with your code.
It should not be very long, but it should: a) state the goal of your project; b) reformulate the problem in terms of functions that you plan to code; 
c) describe briefly what each of the functions aims to accomplish; d) state the program limitations and possible future improvements.

2. **6 points -- Three independently defined original functions**

Three independently defined original functions -- 2 points per function. You can use one of the functions that we defined in class/in homeworks, but for it to count as original, it has to be modified/expanded.

3. **2 points -- A 7 min. oral presentation + 3 min. for questions**

A clear and well-structured presentation of the write-up (you can just walk us through your .ipynb file). You get 1 point for the presentation, 0.5 points for answering questions about your presentation
and 0.5 points for your questions about other people's work.

**You can work on your final project alone or in pairs, in the latter case, please each submit a separate file, the write-up part of the project should be done individually**

### Timeline

28.09 -- consultation (19.30 - 21.00)

12.10 -- oral presentations online, in zoom, (18.10 - 21.00), code and the write-up are due by noon -- **no late work is accepted**

#### Final Project Suggestions

##### Data analysis

Read the contents of a file/webpage (.csv, .txt, html). Parse the contents (using regular expressions, a tokenizer, beautiful soup). Compute some basic stats (the mean, the total, the sum, the most frequent etc.). Visualize the basic stats (draw some plots).

##### Introducing a new module

Introduce a module that we haven't discussed in class, e.g., a module for parsing Praat files, or a module for working with JSON, describe what the module is used for and what it is useful for, show us how at least three methods of this module work, provide examples.

##### Funky dictionary

Create a dictionary of funky (Russian) words -- slang, expressives, old-fashioned words, fairytale characters. If the word is already in the dictionary, the user will be able to see its definition and rate(!) it. If the word is not in the dictionary, the user should have an option of adding it and its definition to the dictionary. The user should have an option of seeing the words with the top most ratings. May be, you could also add the *fortune cookie word game* -- the user gets a randomly chosen word as a sort of prophecy for the day.

##### Tokenizer 2.0

Write a more advanced version of the tokenizer that you have written for HW3 question 1. For example, you could make use of regular expressions that we have learnt today. You can choose any language, including English, but if you choose English, you will have to write a truly decent version of a tokenizer (and you won't be allowed to just import existing tokenizer modules for English).
